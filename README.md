Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marduk.
Thank you for visiting my page.

Here I plan to "show my work" as I learn.
I am not sure where this page will lead but I hope it helps others.

If I learn it, I will do my best to get it on here in some way.
Hopefully I will be able to keep it organized in some way that will be easy to follow. Not like my brain which can be quite chaotic.
