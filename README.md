Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marduk.
Thank you for visiting my page.

Here I plan to "show my work" of what I have learned and what I continue to learn.
I am not sure where this page will lead but I hope, at the very least, be a help to others.

If I have learned it, I will do my best to get it on here in some way.
Hopefully I will be able to keep it organized in a fashion that will be easy to follow. Not like my brain which can be quite chaotic.

If you have a question about anything, or find something that is wrong, or just want to say 'Hello'
